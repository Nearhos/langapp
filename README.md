# langapp


## Inspiration

We realized the best way to learn language is through conversations about meaningful passions and we wanted to make a platform where users are able to do so. Learning languages are so important to stay connected. Our team has always had a passion for Ai and we wanted to implement it in our project.

## What it does

Glossa is a web app that allows users to have a deep and meaningful conversation with an Artificial Intelligence language model that can chat in any language of the users choosing. Learning languages though chat and conversation is one of the best ways to learn and practise them!

## How we built it

We used React for our frontend and backend.

## Challenges we ran into

As this was the first time using React for some of our group members there was a slight learning curve. We had some issues using our API as it's a reality new technology we have implemented.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are super proud of creating a functional app that we believe is going to help educate and provide amazing learning to millions worldwide.

## What we learned

As we stayed up till 5 in the morning we really learned a lot about each other as a team and of coure React.

## What's next for Project Glossa

Potentially try to become profitable with Google Ads. We want to improve the Ui/Ux to be more user friendly and aesthetically pleasing. Its something we did not have a major focus on because we wanted functionality to come first
